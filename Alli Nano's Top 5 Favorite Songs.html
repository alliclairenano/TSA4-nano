			<p>Alec narrates a story of kindness and care, finding himself in the midst of a woman in a seemingly-abusive relationship. Alec portrays a gentle way to help her cope with her feelings, accepting her dismissals of an issue but emphasizes his presence and care when she feels ready to talk.</p>

			<p>Hi this is Ricky. This song is about my dad’s issues with alcoholism and closeted bisexuality, neither of which he dealt with before his death. 
			He chronically cheated on his partners, as well. It’s an exploration of what was going through his head, and how it influences my own life so long after his death. 
			I quit drinking around the time that this song came out, and didn’t drink at all from age 21-24. 
			Lots of the songs on this album deal with cyclic abuse in families, a theme that continues into the rest of my work. 
			Ultimately, it’s a celebration of sexual fluidity, a rejection of binary, and the lifelong struggle to cope with the problems we inherit from our parents (whether that means alcoholism, sexual confusion, violent urges, etc). 
			I don’t mind when folks think this song is about gay yearning – in many ways it is – but that’s not all it’s about. I don’t think I’ve ever written a song that was about just one thing.</p>

			<p>In this song dedicated to his sister, Alec discusses how hope and a good environment can help overcome adversity. 
			The first verse talks about a pregnant school friend who worked day and night to support her soon-to-be-born child. 
			Then, he details how his grandparents faced troubles together. Lastly, Alec refers to his love for his parents and sister. 
			Every verse concludes the same way: each character is strengthened by their loved ones.</p>
